Hello!
This place is for people who are bored out of their minds and have a Seeed Wio Terminal with them.
To upload programs to the Wio, copy the main code and paste it into the code.py or main.py file (Whatever you see in the file manager)
Then save the file and restart the Wio!

Dependencies:
CircuitPython Lib bundle 9.x
The builtin text file. It is required for all games and apps for rendering.

Upcoming:

Potassium:
  
  A file manager for the Wio, put it in the code.py file and put all other programs in the soon-to-be Programs folder. Potassium will allow you to have multuple programs on it,
  and even run them simultaneously!

Networker:
  
  A BlE + WiFi connectivity service.
  Will need a lot of work, BLE and WiFi do not really work on CircuitPython. Feel free to make a pull request and help out!
 
Make a comment if you want anything special!

Happy gaming!
