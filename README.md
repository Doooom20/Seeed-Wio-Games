Hello!
This place is for people who are bored out of their minds and have a Seeed Wio Terminal with them.
To upload programs to the Wio, copy the main code and paste it into the code.py or main.py file (Whatever you see in the file manager)
Then save the file and restart the Wio!

Dependencies:
CircuitPython Lib bundle 9.x, and the builtin_font.vlw file. 
They are required for rendering and playing for all games and apps.

Upcoming:

Brick Baller. 
A breakout game.

Networker:
  
  A BlE + WiFi connectivity service.
  Will need a lot of work, BLE and WiFi do not really work on CircuitPython. Feel free to make a pull request and help out!
 
Make a comment if you want anything special!

Happy gaming!
